    <h1>Cello is the Best Instrument</h1>
    <p>(You cannot change my mind.)</p>

    <h2>Read on, to find out why...</h2>

    <ul id="list">
        <li>Science argues that it mimics the human voice. 
            <br>(Personally, I lean more towards the idea that it mimics the voice of angels! Jk. 
            <br>I don't know what that would exactly sound like.)</li>
        <li>It's range is vast, spanning so many octaves.</li>
        <li>It's versatile and can be used in any genre.</li>
        <li>You don't have to stand up to play it.</li>
        <li>It can save the world (lol).</li>
    </ul>

  <p class="random">Don't know what a cello looks like? No worries. I have included a few pictures below for examples.</p>
